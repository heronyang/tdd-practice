# TDD Practice

This is the code template for "Clean Code Workshop" hosted for AlphaCamp members. See [this link](http://clean-up-your-spaghetti.heron.me/) for further content.

## Goal

Basic Test Driven Development Practice

You have to complete 3 TODOs in the code.

## Setup

- Copy this code to your local machine:

> git clone https://github.com/heronyang/tdd-practice.git

- Open ```index.html``` in your browser

## Code

- ```index.html``` is the main page that you can read the result of the tests, but you don't have to modify this file
- ```tests.js``` contains the unit tests will be run
- ```main.js``` contains the js functions that you write for your program

Again, you have to finish 3 TODOs in the code (2 in tests.js, 1 in main.js) and pass all the tests.

## Submit

Share your work in our workshop group (best way is to share the link of your own github repo, but you can use any other method if you found it difficult).
